# Digital Garden

A Digital garden is a place where ideas grow. Unlike blogs, it might not have an article kind of full structure in the beginning. I should be scribbling ideas here on the go. The whole idea of Digital Garden is inspired by my dear friend and mentor [Hrishi](https://stultus.in/) - Check out his digital garden [here](https://wiki.stultus.in/). 

> In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. Itâ€™s about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document. [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain.
