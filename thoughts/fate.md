# Fate

I reached a point in life that I dont belive in fate. It could be totatlly a privilage to be like that. I know I choosed all the steps in my life, or choosed how to respond to things that happended to me. I dont belive in some random magic that will happen to my life and it will change for ever. 

I'm not sure about what will happen to me tomorrow, or what exactly I will be doing in my life, but something I know is, despite of what happens, I will find a way to navigate. That comes from the thought clarity.
