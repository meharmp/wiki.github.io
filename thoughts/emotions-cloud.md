# Emotions Cloud

Most of the times people feels feelings as set of emotions merged in different compsotions. It will take a lot of efforts / thoughts / reading & conversation with people to start understanding and seperating different emotions from the cloud. 

Once we are having that clarity on which all emotions are playing in making the current feelings, it's easy to work on each one of them as separate entities and make peace with each one of them.

It took me really a while to have the clarity / or the skills to see different emotions as separate ones and act on that rather than feeling as a cloud of emotions and react
