# Gratitude

If I want to keep on word with me, let it be gratitude. When ever I see something good in someone, a nice movie I feel grateful about eveything I had. It feels like I'm resposible for all the privillages I'm having. That I should take care people who are less fortunate than I'm. Before that I feel gratified that I get an opportunity to see all these good things happening to me, that I'm appreatiting those, that I got an eye to see all those. 

I'm grateful to people who helped me in finding gratitute.
