# Time is a healer thing

Time is the best healer is a popular thought eveyone quote. I dont believe in change will magically happens, or time is the best healer thing. You need to take informed steps to make the change happen. 

In personal life context, wounds wont automatically heal. You might forget its there untill there is a trigger happens, or it became so normal that you wont recongize it anymore. I wish everyone should be able to do remedial actions as soon as something bad has happened. 

When you get emotionally down with something, try to see a counsillor as soon as you can - or take any help, dont live in pain for ever to the point it changes who you permenantly to live with that pain.
