# Tech Product Ideas

I have seen a lot of great teams got lost by solving a problem that not exists. Finding a good problem that people find it so painful, happy to pay for a solution is the key in building a great product. When you try to find a problem some ways so that you could make a solution and sell it off, most of the time it wont work.

When you start working / doing things , you will find a lot of pain points. There is a possibility of many more people across the world might be facing the same issues. A small plug in, an app, a web app or a few lines of script could do a lot of work. There are a lot of developers makes $1000s every week by selling small plugins and tools that saves a lot of time and efforts.

### Link sharing tool

A tool that can make a collection of links, like a link tree, and share that list with people. The lists can be shared with a selected set of people only, not public.

### Mac Android Clipboard sharing tool

I wish to see a free / minimal cost tool to do this. Right now I open telegram in phone and mac to share text between devices

### A career check

Most of the times, people find it hard to believe in themself that they have enough of skills or done enough things to be ready to apply for a job. A check list that they can refer to make basics ready would be helpful. 

Update: Found this interesting tool made by a MEC Alumni. [Really Confused](https://reallyconfused.co)

### Android TV Dashboard Tool

We have an android TV in flat. I needed that to be used for work needs. An android TV app that could load a specific webpage will do the work. If there is an option to have a list of pages and manage that from the backend it will be cool. I could use the big screen to have a look at the dashbords I have made. 

### WhatsApp Chat Viewer

When you back up / export a chat to mail from whatsapp, it will be text file. When you try to open it, it will be really look like a log file and will be really hard to read. It will be great if there is a tool, that could read this file and arrange the conversation in the way we see inside whatsapp , so that we can read it easily like a conversation. 

### Discord Meeting scheduler bot

A bot that will schedule a meeting from discord chats & then sent event invitations to all people who agreed.
