# നഗര സന്ധ്യകൾ \| City nights

When was the last time you were in a rooftop pub? 

Friday nights were still reserved for young and stupid



Lights of those slow-moving traffic in metros 

Nice music playing and all those fairy lights



Catching up with old friends and some new ones 

Trying to strike a conversation with single ones



We had an opportunity to walk to the windows and 

talk about poems and life while looking at the city



I really hope we will go back to those evenings someday, 

that you hold yourself to continue where we left off
