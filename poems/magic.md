# Magic

You know what magic is, magic is being able to touch someone's soul. Defusing into their soul, just like the mist passing through us, we share a moment in our life times, we feel the presence and like the way it came, it slowly fades away. But I'm glad that we had this moment together, this shared feelings, this mist that just in it. There would be a lot of beautiful sunsets and starry nights awaits in eatch others life, mostly with someone else. But when I look back / see something that reminds you, I feel this chillness of the mist that we shared.
