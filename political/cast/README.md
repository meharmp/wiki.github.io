# Caste

## Caste is something that defines Indian society. It's worse than the colour in the United States. The only single injustice I can think about bigger than caste in scale is gender. 

Even though I live in India, I haven't experienced anything personally, because

1. I'm from Kerala, one of the most forward-thinking & developed society in India.
2. I born in a Muslim family, there is no caste inside Islam‌

##  Why makes caste so interesting for me

It's the most subtle injustice for most of my peer group & the biggest factor that defines why India like this even after 70 years of freedom.

‌ Sometimes it's so hard for me to explain these injustices to people, I will be wondering it's so in and around you, why can't you just see that.

‌ Then I learned about privileges. Now each day, I'm reminded about my privileges.

## Resources to learn about Caste

Curating some of the resources that helped me to understand caste, thought might be helpful for some people who care to learn.
