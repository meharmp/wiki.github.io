# Caste

Caste is something define indian society. Its worser than the colour in United States. Only single injustice i can think about bigger than caste in scale is gender. 

Even though I live in india, I  havent exprianced anything personally, because

1. I'm from Kerala, one of the most forward thiking & developed society in india.
2. I born in a muslim family, there is no caste inside islam

## Why makes caste so interesting for me

Its the most subtle injustice for most of my peer group & biggest fator that defines why india like this even after 70 years of freedom. 

Sometimes its so hard for me to explain these injustive to people, I will be wondering its so in and around you, why can't you just see that. 

Then I learned about privillages. Now each days, I'm reminded about my privillages.
