# Building a change in your society

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Taking ownership of problems, working every day to build a better environment for you and the people around is the way we became a better society I believe.

I dont believe in change will magically happen, or time is the best healer thing. You need to take informed steps to make the change happen.
