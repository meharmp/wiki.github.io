# Building a change in your society

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Taking ownership of problems, working everyday to build a better environment for you and people around is the way we became better society I believe.

I dont believe in change will magically happens, or time is the best healer thing. You need to take informed steps to make the change happen.
