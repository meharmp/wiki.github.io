# Contact

To be frank, I choose my people and choose whom I spent time with very continuously. My most preffered way of conversation is in person - going for, having a meal together. Mostly do only with people i really know in person.

[Email](mailto:meharmp@gmail.com) and [Instagrm](http://instagram.com/meharmp) are two ways. Things related with TinkerHub can be send to hello@tinkerhub.org

WhatsApp could be the best way to get a response. Can't share the number here, you could get that from mail or instagram.

I dont like surpises, unless someone is not dying, please dont ring up.
