To be frank, I choose my people and limit whom I spent time with very continuously. My most preferred way of conversation is in person - going for walk, having a meal together. Mostly do only with people i really know in person.

[Email](mailto:meharmp@gmail.com) \( mail@meharmp.in / meharmp@gmail.com \) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/meharmp) are two ways. Things related with TinkerHub can be send to hello@tinkerhub.org

WhatsApp could be the best way to get a response. Can't share the number here, you could get that through mail or Instagram.

I don't like surprises, unless someone is not dying, please don't ring up.
