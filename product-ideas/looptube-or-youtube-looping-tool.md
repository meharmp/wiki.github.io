# LoopTube | YouTube Looping Tool

I'm vibing to Ole Melady from Thallumala for last two days. A part of the song is really giving me an adrinaline rush and I wanted to hear that part alone.&#x20;

I was wondering about creating a tool that could loop a specific part of YouTube for some time, but today found this tool that could simply do the same.&#x20;

Check out the clipped part in infitie loop [here](https://looptube.io/?videoId=WD87mrr6umk\&start=110.53274336283187\&end=145.55752212389413\&rate=1)

Creating such small tools like this could be something interesting project for a weekend ðŸš€ Â &#x20;
