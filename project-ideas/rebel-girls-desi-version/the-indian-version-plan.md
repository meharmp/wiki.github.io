# The Indian version plan

India is a very wast country with a wide diversity of cultures. There was & are a lot of amazing women who fought against all odds of patriarchy & created a place for them in our history. From former prime minister Indira Gandhi to KK Shailaja, Phoolan Devi to Shakuntala Devi, Kalpana Chawla to Tessy Thomas. There are thousands of other stories of women who have contributed to society & didn't get the kind of attention they deserved. 

### Why an Indian version

Referring back to relatability, It will be more relatable for us to hear about a Dalit IPS officer in Bihar than a black first lady in the USA. We need to celebrate local stories in local languages.

### The plan

Create an Indian version of Rebel Girls. Curate stories create categories & publish.

1. Make a detailed plan & how we want to publish
2. Decide on the themes
3. Secure funding for the team
4. Hire / Get people who can get the stories
5. Translate to local languages \(if we are doing that\)
6. Make designs
7. Create marketing strategies
8. Print book

### My Involvement

There are N number of projects I wish to see in the world. Even though I wanted to get involved, It's not practically possible to work on a lot of projects at the same time. So generally I tend to find people who wish to do that or I support people who already do that with whatever resource I can contribute.

But in this project, I wish to be a co-founder or get involved actively. 

### What I can bring to the table

* This idea
* Setting up a team
* Some personal financial contributions
* An experts panel/advisers
* Connect with publishers
* Designers
* Networks to collect stories

### What I'm looking for right now

A women cofounder, who understand inequalities like patriarchy & cast in India. Somebody who can relate to the struggles of Indian women & keen on making a difference.

### Future Scope

This can make some good money if done for-profit company style. Could be a next level NGO / Social impact organisation if done as a non-profit. Either way, it's possible to make this a financially viable idea.
