# Standing own feet 101 for Mallu girls

Many of the opportunities that the digital explosion gave us are the possibility to be financially independent with our skills. 

Being able to travel, get a flat in a city all are possible to far more people right now. This was not the case a decade before. 

However, patriarchy didn't grow/evolved to the rate our girls are being exposed to the possibilities and the independent women they are becoming. Having a peer group/knowledge space to understand how others have cracked the patriarchal issues at home and societies to lead a life of their own style would be really helpful.

This could be a portal starting with when to get married or stories and experiences of people who choose not to marry. How to handle the situations around the marriage thing and the results. 

### Some potential topics

1. Financial independence 101

3. Dealing with log kya kahenge within ourselfs
4. The imposter syndrome
