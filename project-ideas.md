# Social Project Ideas

There are a lot changes I wish to see in the world, like everbody else I also have a very limited time to invest in everything I like. Since I cant work full time on eveything I like to see, I could make it up by contributing to the misssion by other means. Like networks, a little bit of finantial aid and mentoring. 

What we do at TinkerHub is a change many wish to see. Thats why a lot of people contribute to the mission in many ways like finantially, with their time or with their network.

Doing good increasigly became easy with the emerge of social media, you could tell your story, about the change you wish to see, the work you do, and people from different walks of life, who are connected to the cause in different ways will come together to contribute and make it a reality. 

People might be really surprised to hear this perspective or wont belive at all. That you could lead a life while doing the things you loved to do. That you dont need to go to a day job to realise the social change you wanted to see. Trust me, I'm doing that and so do you. 

We have a small network of people who do social impact ideas. All are maturing and figuring out their ways slowly. It might take time to be finantially sustainable, but its possible.

You dont pay for schools in kerala \( Private schools are really negligible in numbers [according to Kerala Niyamasabha](http://www.niyamasabha.org/codes/ginfo_1.htm) \), Health Care and a lot of things. Hows that happening, we all pool togther money as taxes, selected some of us to do the common feciliites for all of us as MLAs & MPs. Thats the way goverment actully work. Its possible in all scales, local hosuing colonies to United Nations, People collaborate to meet the common goals. 

Finding people with common goal is the only missing part. They will bring rest of the resources to make the common dream a reality.
