People who are insecure makes controlling behaviour. They fear that if their romantic partners are in free space, they may meet new interesting people and might leave them. That's the reason boyfriends didn't allow girlfriends to go for campus tours and trips with friends. The same go for GFs questions about all of her BFs female friends.

Where do these Kalippans coming from

Kalippans or angry men are by-products of patriarchy, who don't have an option to open up their mind or have a shoulder to cry on. They are asked not to show vulnerability or any emotions because men needed to be men. And men are powerful and control.

What we can do 1. Get out, you need an equal playground to have a conversation and make people understand that it's not going to work in a master-slave model. 2. Understand, end of the day what everyone seeks for peace, a place where nobody judges. If you can, be that understanding, never judging a person to them.

I feel so pity for all these angry controlling people as all I can see is a soul crying for care and love inside them.
