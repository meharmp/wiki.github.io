# Move out

Move from your home town for some time Get a small space for yourself in a busy city. Earn enough to take you for a self date. Observe yourself, what you choose when you are the freedom to choose anything. Know yourself better. Have some post time. Go for a walk sometime. Fall in love with yourself. Life will be good, try a few things and meet the real you. Make some friends Date a few. Do this before you settle for the 'for ever'
