# Move out üèô

Move from your home town for some time. Get a small space for yourself in a busy city. Earn enough to take you for a self date. Observe yourself, what you choose when you have the freedom to choose anything. Know yourself better. Have some 'post' time. Go for a walk. Fall in love with yourself.  Try a few things and meet the real you. Make some friends, Date a few. Do these before you settle for the 'forever' Life will be good :\)
