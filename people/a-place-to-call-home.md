# A place to call home

While I was in Kozhikode with KSUM for two years, something really missed is having space/flat. Keeping a place for my people to come and feel at home was something on top of my mind. When somebody I care about seems to need help/feel lost, I really feel great to tell "come home, stay with us for few days"

Just before this lockdown came to Kozhikode. Staying with family feels so good. Still, the last few days I was kind of missing that there is somebody waiting to come to the flat, all those beautiful conversations while watching raining from my balcony.

It was raining here tonight, it feels so good to be alive. Completed this small piece have a read.
