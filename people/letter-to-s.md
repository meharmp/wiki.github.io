# Letter to S



```
I had sex with more women than I wanted to be 
But I do what to sleep with more women 
I wanted to sleep next to more Men 
I just want to sleep next to people I care I want to hug them before they go to sleep 
Often times I wanted to kiss the back of their necks 
I wanted to kiss the forehead of people I care 
I just want to make people safe and cared 
I wanted to tell people that they are loved For who they are, 
for whom they wanted to be 
there is a point beyond sex, 
Of course, I like having sex with people 
But always I value people for who they are 
I just wanted everyone around me to be free 
Free to do anything they wish to do without being judged 
I wanted to become a space where everyone feels safe 
I just wanted to be something that they were missing from their life
â€Œ
I'm high tonight but S, I just wanted you to know, that you are 
deeply cared for and loved. For the person you were, 
you are and you wanted to be. you are loved from the core of my heart. 
Be peaceful as you were always.
