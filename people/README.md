# People

It took me a while to see how different people are shaped up. Life was in autopilot for me for first two and half decades of my life. I didn't know how homes, families, parents and environment shapes different people to be who they are for a really long time in their life. I thought every home was like mine, everyone else was like me. Then it took a while to have deeper conversations and to see how much stories and experiences each one of us were having. 

From the time I figured how how my emotions are working, I was really really curious about how others feel and see things. I really started to build deeper conversations, about things that actually matters but not many talks about. Like insecurities, self doubts, little joys that they only know, stories that shaped them. 

Figuring out ourselves and figuring out others \( Relationships \) became my favourite thing to hear, to discuss and share experiences.  

**This section of garden primarily deals with notes about how do i see people, my reflections on different kinds relationships and experiences people shared with me.**
