# The five people around you

Even today I was wondering how people see things so differently. When we work/think 24x7 how to build a skilled youth for tomorrow, most of the people are stuck in shabari mala.  
  
This is something very true. I'm always grateful for the kind of people I was having at the end of my college days. They shaped my views.  
  
From there I deliberately choose people around me, and those people added many more. Today all my Eve's and even social feeds are stories of people who are challenging the status quo, taking action, building something new. So dear people, choose your closed ones. Let those people be kind, loving and with a mindset to grow.
