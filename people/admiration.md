# Admiration

I had a huge admiration for women in power, women in control, women who know who they are. Despite decades-long oppression and the whole world against them, how do they do these amazing things? I always wonder about people who are brave enough to reimagine the world, when I will be one like them.

I have goosebumps when meeting / knowing about such women exists.
