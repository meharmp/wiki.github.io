Start with why is a popular Ted talk & a Book by Simon Sinek. Even though there are different perspectives about the specific topic, The idea of start with why really helped me to get thought clarity, especially during early days of my career.&#x20;

Before doing anything, especially in work I think why am I doing this. What is my actual goal, what am I trying to achieve here. This asking me why really helped in getting clarity. Many of the times we may get lost in the process of doing things and ultimately forgot why we started to do this whole activity in the first time.

I believe best way to get clarity is to remove / avoid as many options as possible. So asking why before doing thing will help you to avoid doing things that wont matters.
