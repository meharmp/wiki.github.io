# Parippu vada theory

A couple of years back, we were sitting near a shop after college hours. The shop was a Baji Kada that makes hot evening snacks. Eby asked everyone "out of all the parippu vadas, which one Mehar will choose"

Nobody had a clue, then eby said that will be the most കറിഞ്ഞ പരിപ്പുവട \( overcooked cookie \)

Everyone was curious about this and asked me why, and my philosophy was it was not parippuvadas fault that it became overcooked and somebody need to eat that, I can be that somebody because none of you will choose it.

Eby made up this story about me, because the girl I was dating before that and all my crushes were the least good looking ones in a group of girls. Kaheenam girls they call for not so great-looking people.

Hence the theory named as mehar's parilpuvada theory of ksheenam girls.

That was fun those days, might feel offended that's why I didn't post it public for a while. Honestly, we didn't know about political correctness/body shaming back then. But in my defence, I have seen people beyond physical looks or find them interesting.
