This principle is an interesting one. Waiting for everyone to accept who you are / what you believe wont help. Some may change after seeing what you have done, some dont accept your ideas at all, but thats okay. 

Stop waiting for the magic to happen. Its your life and do what you feels right, as long as it wont take away anyone else's fundamental rights.
