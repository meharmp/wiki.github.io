# Theory of relatability in real life

Relatability is something core to my principles around social change. It's not like oppressed / underprivileged people want to improve their quality of life, but when they dont have seen enough people like them doing that, it might be hard for them to believe in themselves, that it's possible to change the life for the better. Many considered themselves as victims of life, mostly because they dont have that confidence to make a difference in their life, that they are not in control of it. 

How to change that or how it changes, well in my theory seeing people of their kind \( having all the issues they are facing \) still figured out a way to make life in control and succeed in that. 

At TinkerHub, we make sure that our പിള്ളേർസ് \( learners \) see enough of their sort of people, from similar backgrounds, learned something and succeeded in life.
